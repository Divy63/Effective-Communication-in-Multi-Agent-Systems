## Abstract
Communication is crucial in multi-agent systems, which are groups of computer agents cooperating with one another. This paper examines inter-agent communication protocols, including KQML and FIPA, and identifies common communication issues. By understanding these issues, strategies can be developed to improve communication, facilitating more seamless collaboration and faster decision-making among agents.

## Introduction
In recent times, multi-agent systems (MAS) have become a significant field of research in artificial intelligence (AI). A multi-agent system consists of multiple decision-making agents working together or against each other within a shared environment to achieve their goals. This section introduces the concept of MAS, their applications, and the importance of effective communication among agents.

## Communication Protocols
This section delves into the specific communication protocols used in MAS, such as KQML and FIPA. It explains how these protocols enable agents to share information and coordinate actions.

## Challenges in Communication
Despite the existence of communication protocols, agents in MAS often face communication challenges. These challenges may arise from differences in agent capabilities, conflicting roles, or misalignment of goals. This section explores these challenges in detail.

## Proposed Solutions
After identifying the communication challenges, this section proposes strategies to overcome them. The solutions aim to enhance the agents' ability to collaborate, share information accurately, and achieve their goals more efficiently.

## Conclusion
The paper concludes by summarizing the key findings and emphasizing the importance of addressing communication issues in MAS to improve their overall performance and effectiveness.
